        <h2 class="mb-sm-3">London Marketing Seminar Series</h2>

        <p>The London Marketing Seminar Series connects marketing scholars in the wider London area, with over half of all faculty in London signed-up. </p>
        <p>The idea is that business schools across London open up their research seminars, guest talks, and mini-conferences to the wider community, leading to cross-institutional exchanges. Since being founded in December 2022, Bayes, KCL, Imperial, and LSE have already hosted over a dozen events, with regular attendance from other London schools, such as LBS, UCL, ESCP, and other UoL schools. </p>
        <p>Any marketing researcher who is based at a London university, or regularly in London, can sign-up to share and receive information about marketing research seminars taking place in London. The mailing list is managed GDPR compliant, with all members approved, but joining and sharing announcements with the list is a simple process, you can either <a href="mailto:andres.gvirtz@kcl.ac.uk">message me</a> and I will add you manually, or you can follow these steps: </p>
        <p>1. You click <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?SUBED1=LONDON-UNI-MKT-RESEARCH-SEMINARS&A=1">HERE</a> for the link to sign-up with your name and academic e-mail address.</p>
        <p>2. You will get an automated e-mail with a link you have to click to confirm your e-mail address (if you don’t receive it within a couple of minutes, check the spam folder).</p>
        <p>3. A mailing list admin reviews all sign-ups and approves you within 48h (Please use your academic e-mail address, as this saves me much time when verifying every account).</p>
        <p>4. Congrats, you are part of the e-mail list and can share information with the entire list, as well as receive the seminar announcements shared with the list. </p>

            <p class="m-md-0">I have been a Y-Combinator finalist, as well as an analyst for blue-chip companies. An extended interest in aerospace led to the creation of CompactCopters, which provides B2B engineering and consulting services. A cool side project CompactCopters supported are drones dancing in a show. You can see part of the performance in Britain's Got Talent, or a making of video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuP4YhMzt3k">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="mb-1">• McKinsey &amp; Company</p>
            <p class="mb-1">• Boston Consulting Group</p>
            <p class="mb-1">• UBS</p>
            <p>• PricewaterhouseCoopers</p>
            <p>I worked especially with finance clients, helping them realize organizational goals with the help of data analysis. Examples include using advanced analytics insights to improve debt collection by remodeling a bank’s communication strategy or automating an analysis tool diagnosing cooperation issues within functional units of organizations. In addition, I also worked as a data science researcher for the Nokia Bell Labs.</p>

        <p>I am extremely grateful for the many institutions that provided mentorship and companionship throughout my education.</p>
        <p>Most of my education was made possible through a generous scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung). I serve nowadays on the selection committee for new scholars, and during my studies served five years as scholars’ representative. If you are a current scholar thinking about an academic career, or moving to the UK, my inbox is always open! </p>
        <p>I am the incoming chair and current member of the United Nations Committee for the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP), which has received consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). I started being involved with SPSP during graduate school, where I was on the student committee and organised professional development opportunities for graduate students. We also coordinated international writing groups, with over five hundred involved graduate students. </p>
        <p>At Cambridge, I served as graduate representative for the department and the Economic and Social Research Council, making sure that graduate students’ concerns are heard at the administrative and faculty level. Among others we created graduate buddy systems to improve students’ well-being. I nowadays support Cambridge's undergraduate admission process for Psychological and Behavioural Sciences. I still feel very connected with my undergraduate, and am happy to be part of the young alumni council. </p>
        <p>At home, you can often find me in the kitchen, where I applied to be the sous-chef after short courses at Leiths School of Food and Wine (London) and Le Cordon Bleu (Paris) - outcome still outstanding. I also enjoy photography and playing floorball, a version of indoor hockey. I had previously played for 12 years for the UCH/Floorball Club Heidelberg (Germany). I also rowed (crew) for two terms for King’s College Cambridge – but decided that I rather spend 5 am in bed. </p>
